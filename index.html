          "All human beings are entrepreneurs. When we were in the caves, we
          were all self-employed... finding our food, feeding ourselves. That's
          where human history began. As civilization came, we suppressed it. We
          became 'labor' because they stamped us, 'You are labor.' We forgot
          that we are entrepreneurs. The poor themselves can create a
          poverty-free world. All we have to do is to free them from the chains
          that we have put around them.Human beings are much bigger than just
          making money. Making money is no fun. Contributing to and changing the
          world is a lot more fun."
